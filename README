phpjobs is a small set of scripts to start and manage php-cli jobs running in
the background of a PHP-enabled HTTP server.
It allows PHP scripts to run for longer than the usual time limitations: PHP's
set_time_limit(), php-fpm's request_terminate_timeout, HTTPd/CGI time out.
However, please note it cannot circumvent system-level measures such as
mechanisms killing every process belonging to a hosted user if it ran for more
than x seconds.
It is designed with Linux in mind and will probably remain useless on Windows.
Also, it requires a PHP setup able to execute commands (i.e. forget SafeMode).
Last but not least, security is not implemented; it is considered part of the
PHP configuration file. Typically, you will want to check for a secret key in
headers or something like that. Do whatever you want to.
